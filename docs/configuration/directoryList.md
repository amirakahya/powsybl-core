Since on a target machine the powsybl sources code and binaries can be located in different locations,
in the projects' documentation we are referring to specific paths using some variables/prefixes, as described below:   

* `<POWSYBL_HOME>`: represents powsybl's root installation folder (the default is $HOME/powsybl). 
* `<POWSYBL_SOURCES>`: represents powsybl's sources directory; as the default is $HOME/powsybl-core.
* `<POWSYBL_DOCS>`: represents powsybl's docs directory; as the default is $HOME/powsybl-core/docs. 
* `<POWSYBL_SAMPLES>`: represents powsybl's samples directory; as the default is $HOME/powsybl-core/docs/samples.


Please change them, to reflect your development/installation scenario.
